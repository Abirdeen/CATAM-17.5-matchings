# CATAM-17.5-matchings
A rewrite of my Cambridge CATAM undergraduate project, "Matchings".

## Haskell

Haskell is a pure functional language with lazy evaluation. While this style is rare in modern programming, it encourages programmers to think more carefully about the structures they build and the way they pass around data. For this graph-theoretic project, it encourages careful attention to ideas of recursion and tabulation.

## The project

The aim of this project is to study [matchings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)) in [bipartite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph).
